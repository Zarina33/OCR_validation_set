This repository is dedicated to creating a **validation dataset specifically designed for OCR (Optical Character Recognition) models**. The dataset and associated scripts aim to facilitate the evaluation and improvement of OCR systems by providing high-quality, curated validation samples.

## Purpose

- To provide a reliable validation set tailored for OCR model benchmarking.
- To support OCR model development with realistic and challenging validation data.
- To enable reproducible and standardized evaluation of OCR performance.

## Repository Contents

- Validation dataset files (images and annotations).
- Scripts and tools for dataset creation, preprocessing, and validation.
- Documentation on dataset format and usage.

*(Note: Specific dataset structure and scripts should be detailed here if available.)*

## Usage

1. **Download or clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zarina33/OCR_validation_set.git
cd OCR_validation_set
```

2. **Explore the validation dataset**  
   Use the provided images and annotations to evaluate OCR models.

3. **Run any preprocessing or evaluation scripts** (if included):

```bash
python evaluate_ocr.py
```

*(Adjust script names according to actual files.)*
